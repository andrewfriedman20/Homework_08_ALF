# Portfolio for Andrew Friedman (updated)

This is a portfolio page for the consideration of future employers in the full-stack web development space. The page provides three work samples in its main body: A group project called "Save Your Date! The Restaurant Decisionmaker," "Password Generator," and "The White House Staff Quiz." Each is accompanied by either a screen shot or an animated gif showing user operation. Each portfolio item also includes two live links: one to the deployed page of the project in question, and one for its GitHub Repository.

On the left side of the screen (this is true for both mobile AND desktop), additional information is served. A screen shot of and a link to my LinkedIn profile, a screen shot and link to my main GitHub page that contains pinned projects, and screen shots of and a link to a pdf of my resumé. 

In the footer of the page, my name, email address, phone number, and location are listed. More granular contact information (address, etc) is listed in the resumé pdf.

This portfolio is currently in a rather simple HTML and CSS form, but I fully intend to refine both its look and its content -- as well as, of course, its functionality using javaScript, jQuery, bootstrap, and even some APIs. Ooh, and modals, gotta have the modals.
